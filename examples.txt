A mystery trick or treater rang 'Rachael Ray''s (weekdays, syndicated on ABC) doorbell Monday, and a very tall Lady Gaga in drag was at the door. Rachael, wearing a Little Red Riding Hood costume, lifted the veil to reveal that it was Jerry Springer. The look was so bizarre that the audience didn't even realize it was Springer until Rachael and Buddy shouted his name. Still in costume, Jerry sat down and talked about being on the air for 21 years. "Two names: Jerry and Oprah. That's the list ...

In a strange bit of programming The CW devoted over an hour to 'Gaga by Gaultier' (Mon., 8PM ET on The CW), wherein Lady Gaga and French designer Jean Paul Gaultier interviewed one another. The two covered nearly every topic imaginable in the 75-minute running time, including Gaga's love of Madonna. While reports had surfaced recently that Madonna questioned whether Gaga's "obsessions have to do with" Madonna were "rooted in something deep and meaningful, or superficial." Gaga certainly ...

We learned a lot this week. We finally saw how much jibberish the 'Real Housewives' can yell before Andy Cohen reached his breaking point. Jessica Alba learned that she can indeed have sex while pregnant. Gene Simmons learned the hard way that in order to propose to your long-time girlfriend, you must not be so exhausted that you can't form coherent sentences. Lady Gaga confirmed that a 'So You Think You Can Dance' contestant is actually talented. And Kat Von D taught us all the valuable lesson ...

It was awfully nice of Lady Gaga to share the spotlight, even if it wasn't intentional with former 'So You Think You Can Dance' (Thu., 8PM ET on FOX) contestant Mark Kanemura. Kanemura has been very busy since his Top 6 finish in Season 4, but he can currently be found dancing on Gaga's 'Monster Ball' tour. Gaga wasn't on the judging panel tonight, so she could perform a medley of 'The Edge of Glory' and 'You and I.' While she sounded a little nasal at first (reminiscent of her first ...

After a somewhat slow start, it turned into one of the most impressive performance episodes of 'So You Think You Can Dance' (Wed., 8PM ET on FOX) so far this season. Joining the judging panel for the week were 'Chicago' director Rob Marshall and Lady Gaga, who was ready to hire one dancer almost right there on the spot. We think the leaders of the Top 8 emerged fully formed this week. In fact, we've had a Top 4 in our minds, two guys and two girls, for a few weeks, but they really solidified ...

Forget the 'Edge of Glory,' according to a report from Star magazine (via Radar Online), Lady Gaga is on a dangerous edge when it comes to her health.
